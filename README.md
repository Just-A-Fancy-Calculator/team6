JTC Capstone Group Machine Learn Project

## Project Purpose
This repository is a collaborative space for our capstone project team to gain experience working together in GitHub and to share our data. Each team member can contribute their own data, and we are all able to pull and use data from our teammates for our individual capstone projects.

## Getting Started: Cloning and Contributing

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd team6
```
Replace `<repo-url>` with the actual repository URL from GitHub.

### 2. Make Changes Only to Your Folder
Each team member has a dedicated folder (e.g., `aj/`, `drashti/`, `jumoke/`, `stephanie/`, `thomas/`).
**Only edit or add files inside your own folder.**

### 3. Add and Commit Your Changes
After making changes (for example, adding a CSV file), run the following commands:

```bash
git add yourfolder/yourfilename.csv
git commit -m "adding my csv"
git push
```
Replace `yourfolder/yourfilename.csv` with the path to your file.
